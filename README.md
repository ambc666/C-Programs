# C# Programs
My introduction to C# was to creat 4 programs.

Program 1 - Username Creation - 
Was to create a Username by asking for the persons first name and surname then trimming the first name 
and keeping the initial and adding it to the surname to create the username.

Program 2 - Validation Email & Password - 
Asks to enter an email address and password.  Email address uses regex, Password needs to be
at least 8 Characters, 1 Uppercase, 1 Lowercase and 1 number.  Failing this it will error.  Password needs to
be verified also.

Program 3 - Age - 
Program asks for day, month and year you were born.  You get a message depending on which age 
you are in relation to film restrictions. 

Program 4 - Train Tickets - 
There is a train from Coatbridge to Carlisle & Motherwell to Carlisle with different costs.
Depending on how many tickets for adults and children depends on the discount for the tickets.
